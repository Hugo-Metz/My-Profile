			<h1>Hello, I'm Hugo</h1>

			<p>
			Interested in topicality and history from a very young age, I developed a real attraction for mathematics, economics and politics. I am in the first year of business school at EMLV and I am working on my English to be fluent.

			<h2>Openness to the world (sports and cultural activities, specific routes)</h2>
			<P>
				I played in a basketball club for more than 10 years and have been a member of a tennis club for 5 years. At the age of 6, I started playing drums and a few years later I joined a band. We participated in events such as the Fetes de la musique and competitions such as the Tremplins des jeunes talents. I had the chance to travel a lot, with my family and through school where I met correspondents. These trips allowed me to gain an opening to the world and to discover other cultures. During my studies, I would like to go abroad in order to immerse myself in another country and perfect my languages.

			<h2>My experiences as an animator</h2>
			<p>
				Over the last two summers I have been discovering the world of work during 8 weeks in a leisure centre in Dambach-la-ville. The first year as a facilitator's assistant, then after completing my BAFA as a facilitator. Having initially supervised children aged 7, my seriousness and ease led me to take care of young people aged 11 to 15. This allowed me to discover teamwork, to learn how to manage groups and to develop my sense of responsibility. I enjoyed creating activities and also blossomed thanks to the good atmosphere that prevailed throughout the 8 weeks.

			<h2>My professional experience</h2>
			<p>
				As part of my internship in my third year class, I discovered the world of business and more particularly that of the factory at Confiserie Rohan in Epfig. Then, in my second year, I did an internship at Cr√©dit Mutuel's head office in Strasbourg, where I was immersed in the world of banking and finance. These internships gave me the opportunity to consolidate my choice of orientation and to get a glimpse of what I could do later on. I spent the last week of the course at the Departmental Basketball Committee and worked as a youth worker in an open-air centre as mentioned above. I also sometimes work in the vineyards during the grape harvest and I am regularly called upon to welcome tourists and help out in family lodge.
